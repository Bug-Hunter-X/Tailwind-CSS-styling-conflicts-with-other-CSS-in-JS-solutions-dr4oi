This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework that uses a different CSS-in-JS solution. For example, if you are using Emotion or Styled-Components alongside Tailwind CSS, you might encounter unexpected styling issues or conflicts. The issue is that both solutions try to manage styles differently, causing unpredictable outcomes.
