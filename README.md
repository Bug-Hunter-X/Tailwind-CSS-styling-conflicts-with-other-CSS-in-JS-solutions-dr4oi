# Tailwind CSS Conflict with Other CSS-in-JS Solutions
This repository demonstrates a bug that occurs when using Tailwind CSS alongside other CSS-in-JS solutions, such as Emotion or Styled-Components.  The conflict can lead to unexpected styling issues and inconsistencies.

## Bug Description
The core issue is a clash between the styling mechanisms. Tailwind injects styles using its own method, while other CSS-in-JS solutions have their own approach. This can result in styles being overridden, ignored, or applied inconsistently.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application (instructions may vary based on the project setup).
4. Observe the styling inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The recommended solution is to avoid using multiple CSS-in-JS solutions within the same project. Choose either Tailwind or a different CSS-in-JS solution to maintain consistency and avoid conflicts.
