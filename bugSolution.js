To solve this issue, you should refactor your code to avoid using conflicting CSS-in-JS solutions. Choose one approach (either Tailwind or another solution like Emotion or Styled-Components) consistently. Here's a possible approach:

**If sticking with Tailwind:**
1. Remove any usage of Emotion or Styled-Components.
2. Ensure all styles are applied using Tailwind's utility classes.

**If switching to a different CSS-in-JS solution:**
1. Remove or comment out Tailwind's configuration and imports.
2. Utilize the chosen CSS-in-JS solution consistently for all styling.

Choosing one method will provide a more predictable and manageable styling process, avoiding conflicts and confusion.
